This is a form-constructor/displayer for <a href="http://www.cmsmadesimple.org"><strong>CMS Made Simple</strong></a>&#8482;, inspired by Samuel Goldstein's FormBuilder module.

It is NOT YET feature-complete.

If you want to compare it with FormBuilder ...
<ul>
<li>easier to use e.g. simpler templates</li>
<li>optimised for high-load processing</li>
<li>revised spam-management</li>
<li>a couple of additional field-types, notably one for Captcha's</li>
<li>a few field-types have less options</li>
<li>a few field-types have more options</li>
<li>other modules may [de]register field-type(s) relevant to them</li>
<li>fewer (or at least, different) bugs</li>
</ul>

FormBuilder forms can be imported.
The module includes an interface for exchanging data with the companion PowerBrowse module (which is also being developed).
